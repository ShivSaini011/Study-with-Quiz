                    Exactly, when a virtual digital asset/token is deployed for a duration that meets or exceeds the

                    One type of asset can circulate over different chains; however, it cannot transfer between those chains.
                    Take Tether (USDT) for example. USDT can circulate over the following networks: Omni, ERC20, and
                    TRC20. But USDT cannot transfer between those networks, for example, USDT on the ERC20 chain cannot
                    be transferred to the TRC20 chain and vice versa. Please make sure you select the right network for
                    deposits and withdrawals to avoid any potential settlement issues.

                    Indeed, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) applicable to a virtual digital asset/token
                    represents a percentage of return on the token deployed by the user. However, it's essential
                    to note that the APY is subject to the yield or returns generated by third-party staking or DeFi
                    protocols where GapxBit deploys these virtual digital assets.
                  </p>
                  <p>It's crucial for users to understand that the APY is not guaranteed, and the actual returns
                    depend on the performance of the underlying third-party protocols. Users will only receive
                    returns if and when they are received by GapxBit from these protocols.</p>
                  <p>Due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the crypto market and associated protocols,
                    returns can vary over time, and there might be instances where returns are lower or higher
                    than initially expected. It's advisable for users to carefully consider the risks and potential
                    rewards before participating in the Earn program or any other yield-generating opportunities..</p>

                    <li>4. GapxBit has the right to modify or withdraw the Earn product or any part thereof, and virtual digital
                      assets/tokens may be removed from Earn, resulting in APY disbursement on a pro-rata basis.</li>
                    <li>5. If virtual digital assets/tokens deployed are delisted, users will be given time to take action; otherwise,
                      GapxBit may close, liquidate, or convert them at its discretion.</li>
                    <li>6.APY is calculated as a percentage of returns in the deployed virtual digital assets/tokens and is dependent on
                      factors such as third-party yield offerings, making it non-guaranteed.</li>
                    <li>7. The APY may be updated periodically or daily by GapxBit. If eligible for a payout, returns will be calculated
                      based on the daily APY percentage during the Earn tenure.</li>
                    <li>8. GapxBit reserves the right to impose fees/charges for Earn. In cases of erroneous or incomplete KYC
                      formalities, GapxBit may delay, block, or nullify any APY credited to a user's account at its sole discretion
                      across its Online Platform(s).</li>

                    Users have the flexibility to place an order for redemption of their virtual digital assets at any
                    time, considering the Terms of Use of GapxBit. However, it's essential to note that if the
                    redemption event occurs before the minimum tenure specified, the user will not be eligible to
                    receive any returns under the Earn program. In such cases, the user may forfeit the potential
                    earnings associated with the initial deployment of the virtual digital assets.
